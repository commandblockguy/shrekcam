This creates a fake video camera with a custom background that can be an image or a video (e.g. Shrek (2001)). It also supports closed captions, which must be in the srt format.

The background detection was stolen from this blog post: https://elder.dev/posts/open-source-virtual-background/

**All of this code is bad. I threw a prototype together in a few hours, then wrote the rest of it in the middle of various Zoom calls.**
This repo is mostly only here so I can show people how this works, or how bad this code is.

## Installation:
Don't.

## License:
You agree not to use this code to evaluate my potential as a future employee.

## Documentation:
Read commands.py.

You can run the `reload` command to reload the commands and process_frame modules. This works well for adding new features while you're supposed to be paying attention to a Zoom call.

## Contributing:
PRs are welcome, if you're insane enough to try to actually get this running on your machine.
